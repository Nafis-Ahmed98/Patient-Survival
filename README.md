# Patient-Survival
Using Python, I developed a Machine Learning model using classification techniques such as Random Forest and SVM classifiers to predict a patient's survival status that have undergone breast cancer surgery.

The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 on the
survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.
• Number of instances: 306
• Number of attributes: 4 (including the class attribute)
• Attribute Information:
1) Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)
2) Patient’s year of operation (year -1900, numerical)
3) Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)
4) Survival status (class attribute)
 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer
 2 = the patient died within 5 years
